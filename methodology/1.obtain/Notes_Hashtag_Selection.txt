Initial Selection:

- Google Search: Canadian Election Hashtags.

- For each major political party (one that holds >0 seats in parliment), each leader
was searched for on Twitter. Their name was turned into a hashtags. A brief scroll through
the top tweets was done. Any slogan like hashtag, or common hashtags that came up were added to the list.

- Twitter handles for political figures were also added.

- Scandals were searched for the election. SNC-Lavalin scandal was searched, and tags mined.

This list is clearly biased, but it is a start. Tags related to events outside of canada (US/Global Politics)
were avoided. US Politics were especially avoided, as the number of tweets regarding US matters can easily overwhelm
our dataset (the #Trump tag alone will generate more tweets than our entire list of tags).

Other things to add later:

- Hashtags related to important public figures and politicians
- Hashtags involving critical canadian issues (oil, diversity, economy, etc).

It would be useful to write a script that mines each tweet for new hashtags, and dynamically appends them to our
list. We will also need an exclusion list to remove US/International tags.
